# Project journal

The story of SDR Agent in the order it happened, with a short retrospective at
the end of each phase. Written for founders who want to see what the process
looked like from the inside, including the parts that went wrong.

## Phase 0: the prototype (Oct 6 to 8, 2026)

### The starting point

On Oct 6 the owner pasted a detailed architecture design for an AI sales
development representative (SDR) into a project scaffolding tool. Its core
rule:

> Jido decides. Ash governs. Oban executes durably. Postgres remembers. OTP
> keeps it alive. Phoenix lets humans operate it.

The design covered the system's layers, its domain objects and how the agent
should be supervised. It said little about who would use the product or what
their day would look like.

### The unattended build

The owner delegated most decisions to two AI agents, Claude Code and Codex CLI,
working side by side, under a written mandate
([ADR-0001](../adr/0001-unattended-build-operating-charter.md)). The mandate
listed decisions the owner had already made, what the agents could decide
alone, and conditions that had to stop the build. Codex was consulted on every
firm decision. The work was cut into fourteen slices (S0 to S13), each built
test-first by one agent and reviewed by the other before it merged.

Notable turns:

- **Provider pivot.** The planned model login was not available, so the real
  model became the Claude CLI running on the owner's own subscription, locked
  down to no tools, no plugins and a per-call check that it really had none
  ([ADR-0004](../adr/0004-model-provider.md)).
- **Audit first.** Every agent decision, model call and human approval goes
  into a hash-chained ledger, anchored with signatures and timestamps, so an
  outsider can verify that nothing was changed afterwards.
- **Wire witness.** The owner chose to delay the demo until each model call
  could also be matched against what actually crossed the network.

By Oct 8: 34 merged pull requests, about 280 commits and close to a
thousand automated tests.

### The demo

The owner demoed the product live at an AI meetup on the evening of Oct 7,
using the real model. Two things the demo needed (wiring the real model into
the app, and showing the agent's risk flags) were not finished in time. They
ran on an unreviewed local patch, which was reverted after the demo and rebuilt
properly through the normal review process the same night.

### After the demo

The owner asked for the highest quality product possible. The agents hardened
what existed: real model wiring, a strict allowlist for the environment of
every child process, and the wire witness switched on. A free HubSpot developer
portal was filled with synthetic companies and contacts for a future CRM
integration.

Then the agents proposed a plan to keep building. The owner rejected it:

> I want to nail down the features and functionality of this product before
> beginning production work. And I also want to determine what the UI/UX
> should look like for human operators.

The owner asked what other parts of the planning process had been neglected.
New feature work was frozen.

### Discovery begins

The owner answered a discovery questionnaire about users, jobs, success
measures, scope, operator experience, agent behaviour, data, deployment and
business goals. Claude and Codex reviewed the answers separately. Both found
the wish list too large for the three weeks before the Nov 6 workshop. The
owner chose:

- the workshop promise: a **first-touch copilot** for solo founders, not a fully
  autonomous SDR;
- **desktop only** for this release;
- emails **captured, never sent**;
- **HubSpot as an optional add-on**, with CSV and manual entry as the core way
  leads arrive.

On Oct 8 the owner asked for a traditional software process, worked through by
the three of us together, with every artifact committed to git. This folder is
the result.

### Retrospective (draft, to be confirmed at G0)

- **Worked:** a written mandate, small slices, test-first work and mandatory
  peer review produced a robust core (audit trail, approval binding, durable
  jobs) very quickly.
- **Did not work:** starting from an architecture prompt instead of a product
  definition. The engine was built before anyone had decided what the operator
  should see, so the UI was thin and the demo needed a patch.
- **Change:** define the user, requirements and design before building more,
  and keep the owner in the loop at every gate instead of only at checkpoints.

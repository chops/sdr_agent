# ADR-0005: OpenTelemetry, Wire Witness, and Audit-Chain Anchoring

## Status

Accepted (2026-10-06, owner decision recorded in ADR-0001: "OpenTelemetry as a
first-class concern, model-content spans and an independent wire witness both
in the MVP, and audit-chain anchoring to a private Git repository plus
OpenTimestamps"). Details amended by Codex consultations 11 and 13.

## Context

ADR-0002 makes Postgres the audit system of record. The owner also wants to
see, live, every trace and what is sent to and received from the model, and
wants evidence that does not depend solely on the application's own database
and code. Three mechanisms answer three different questions:

1. **App telemetry (OTel):** what did the app do and ask for, in one trace?
2. **Wire witness:** what actually left the machine toward the provider?
3. **Anchoring:** has the ledger been rewritten since a point in time?

Local facts: Grafana Tempo accepts OTLP/HTTP on `127.0.0.1:4318` (168h
retention). The owner's `llm-otel-proxy` (`~/src/nix-darwin/packages/llm-otel-proxy`,
`127.0.0.1:8787`, `/openai-codex` route for ChatGPT OAuth traffic, sha256 blobs)
correlates only via `X-Ai-Pair-*` headers and does not read W3C
`traceparent`. With Codex app-server, app-server, not our app, makes the
upstream HTTP call, so our headers do not reach the proxy unless app-server
forwards them.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Postgres ledger only

**Pros:** simplest.
**Cons:** no live trace view; no corroboration independent of app code; no
evidence outside the database.

### Option 2: OTel content spans only

**Pros:** live inspectability in one trace.
**Cons:** records what the app asked for, not what app-server sent upstream;
Tempo is not durable.

### Option 3: OTel content spans, plus proxy wire witness, plus external anchoring

**Pros:** each mechanism covers a gap the others leave.
**Cons:** more moving parts; correlation between app trace and proxy is
initially inferred.

## Decision

We will use Option 3.

### OpenTelemetry (first class, from S4)

- `opentelemetry` SDK with the OTLP/HTTP exporter to `127.0.0.1:4318`;
  instrumentation for Phoenix, Bandit, Ecto, Oban, Req, and Ash; custom spans
  for each Jido signal, action, flow, and agent run.
- GenAI semantic conventions (`gen_ai.*` attributes) on model spans.
- **Content:** full prompt and completion content as span events in **dev,
  for synthetic data only**; everywhere else spans carry IDs and content
  hashes only. Turning content on for real data requires an explicit,
  recorded policy (ADR-0002 retention stance).
- `trace_id` and `span_id` on every audit record; Logger metadata carries them.
- OTel is **diagnostic corroboration, not the system of record**. Tests run
  with exporting disabled; exporter loss never affects the ledger.

### Wire witness (S12)

- Route Codex app-server's upstream traffic through `llm-otel-proxy`; the
  proxy records request and SSE response blobs by sha256.
- Until an end-to-end test proves stable matching, the link between a
  ModelInvocation and a proxy record is labelled **inferred** (time window,
  serialized calls per ADR-0004, app-server PID and version, proxy request
  sequence and timestamps).
- S12 adds explicit invocation or witness-ID propagation (proxy and/or
  app-server configuration) and a reconciliation job that compares
  **canonical payload hashes**, not assumed raw-byte equality. Only after that
  e2e hash test passes may a link be labelled **reconciled**.
- TLS and provider internals remain outside what the witness can prove.
- Owner checkpoint: deploying the proxy change needs `sudo darwin-rebuild
  switch` (ADR-0001).

### Anchoring (S11)

- `SdrAgent.Audit.AnchorSink` behaviour; sinks: `FileSink` (tests),
  `GitSink` (private repository `chops/sdr_agent-audit-anchors`, protected
  against force-push and deletion, append-only signed head files), and
  `OpenTimestampsSink` (only hashes leave the machine; pending and completed
  proofs bundled).
- Cadence: every N events or 15 minutes, and on every export.
- Each anchor record carries: key id, key rotation/revocation status,
  sequence and event range, chain-head hash, prior anchor hash,
  canonicalization version, sdr_agent git commit, anchor-repo commit and blob
  ids, and the sink receipt.
- Signing key: ed25519, private key in `secrets/sdr_agent.sops.yaml`
  (`audit_anchor/ed25519_private_key`), public key and key id committed at
  `docs/audit/anchor-signing-key.pub`.
- **Assurance limits:** GitSink proves continuity and authenticity **within
  the owner's trust domain only** (the owner administers the repository and
  holds the decryption key). OpenTimestamps adds a third-party proof that a
  head existed at a time. Exports state which levels apply (ADR-0002).

## Justification

The three mechanisms answer different audit questions; none substitutes for
the Postgres ledger, and each is labelled with exactly the assurance it
provides, so no artifact over-claims.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Live, single-trace inspectability during development.
- Independent transport corroboration of model traffic.
- Ledger rewrites become detectable against off-database anchors.

### Negative

- Content in Tempo duplicates prompt bodies in a second, non-durable store
  (accepted for synthetic data).
- Wire-witness correlation is weak until S12 proves propagation.
- Same-owner trust limit for GitSink.

### Neutral

- Tempo retention (168h) is irrelevant to audit durability by design.
